An iPhone / iPad app for finding [Geohashing](https://geohashing.site/) hashpoints

This app is not yet finished. Join the conversation at 
[the wiki page](https://geohashing.site/geohashing/User_talk:BrendanTWhite)

I've started building the user interface, but 
it doesn't actually calculate any hashpoints just yet.

I've started putting together an 
[Entity Relationship Diagram](docs/erd.md).

There's also my thoughts on eg
[what the user experience should be](docs/ux_plan_02.md) and 
[what versions of iOS should we support](docs/iOS_versions.md).
