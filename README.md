An iPhone / iPad app for finding [Geohashing](https://geohashing.site/) hashpoints

This app is not yet finished. Join the conversation at

There's no actual code in this repo yet. So far it's just a place for my own thoughts on eg
[what the user experience should be](docs/ux_plan.md) and 
[what versions of iOS should we support](docs/iOS_versions.md).

Of course there will be Swift and SwiftUI code eventually. :-)
